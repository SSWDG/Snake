# Snake
A cd tool chain
# Welcome
I focused on software building and wanted to do a continuous delivery toolchain.
Goal is to provide a service, the user to write a simple engineering configuration file, you can access services through continuous delivery tool chain, automatically generate a Jenkins building assembly line. At the same time also provide the tool chain build process and build results real-time display function, and I want to write a log analytical functions, can automatically error analysis.
I wish I could write some code every day and finish the project.
